## Getting Started

## Intent
Unprimtive is a point-free version of the primtive Javascript objects. It is intended to be used
through composition and other functional things.

* Because Javascript doesn't have native currying nothing is curried. (Predictability is favoured over magic)
* Only the primtive objects plus operators
